#Santa Workshop Optimization using Genetic Algorithms

The goal of this project was to design an effective solution for a constrained scheduling task involving the assignment of families to a limited number 
of available days, while ensuring that each day meets specific attendance requirements. To achieve this, a Genetic Algorithm was developed with a strong 
focus on maintaining solution validity throughout the entire evolutionary process. The method incorporated custom strategies for initialization, selection,
crossover, and mutation, all tailored to respect problem constraints. Additionally, performance was enhanced through the use of optimized data structures 
and numerical libraries. The intended outcome was to generate feasible schedules that balance participant preferences with operational constraints, ultimately 
producing high-quality solutions in a reliable and efficient manner.
